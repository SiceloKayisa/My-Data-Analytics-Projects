## Key Visualizations and Analysis

The dashboard combines used car listing data from various sources, allowing for deep **slicing and dicing** of the data using filters and parameters. Key visualizations include:

* **Sales price trends over time:** A detailed view of total selling price by year.
* **Analysis of average pricing, mileage, fuel type, and transmission:** Comparing different car segments across critical metrics.
* **Used car volume by dealer type and owner types:** Understanding market distribution by seller and car history.
* **Correlation analysis** between various pricing factors.
* **Forecasting** of future pricing based on established trends.

## Key Achievements

Based on the dashboard's analysis, several key trends and metrics were successfully visualized:

* Identified a peak sales period (2015-2020) with total used car sales exceeding \$925 million, providing critical data for inventory and marketing strategy forecasting.
* Analyzed and segmented market volume, revealing that Diesel vehicles dominate the used car count at 4,834 units, followed by Petrol at 3,534 units, guiding procurement and stocking decisions.
* Detected a high-value segment in Electric cars, which, despite low volume (35 units), commanded the highest Average Selling Price (ASP) exceeding \$2 million**, highlighting a premium market opportunity.
* Established that Automatic transmission cars achieve a $1,887,940 ASP, significantly higher than Manual cars, despite Manual cars having a larger market volume (approx. 7,500+ units), informing premium pricing strategy.
