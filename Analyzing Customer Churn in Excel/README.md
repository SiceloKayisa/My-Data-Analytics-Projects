## Case Study Overview

For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this case study, we investigate a dataset from an example telecom company Databel and analyze their churn rates.

Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing the churn rate: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are and how to reduce churn.

Churn is defined as the total number of customers lost over the total customers. This definition varies by industry.
For example in e-commerce a churner could be defined as someone who hasn't made a purchase.

Using Excel's powerful data analysis tools, we've uncovered key insights to help reduce churn rates and improve customer retention strategies.
