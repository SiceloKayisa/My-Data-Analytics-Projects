# Store Sales and Profit Analysis using Python


**Background Information**

Store sales and profit analysis is the task of analyzing the performance of a retail store in terms of its sales and profits. It helps businesses identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to optimize their operations, pricing, marketing, and inventory management strategies to drive revenue and growth. 


**Data Description**

You are provided with the store data **(Sample - Superstore)** in a csv file format containing the sales data. This sales data is made up of order and customer details, product, quantity and the respective sales. You will have to wrangle this data before you communicate your results by performing some computations where needed.<br>

**Aim**<br>

- To analyse the performance of the retail store in terms of its sales and profit.<br>
- To check which months did the store perform better.<br>
- Which products seem to significantly contribute to more sales and profit for the store, and with that knowledge what are the recommendations.<br>
- What can be done to the store to improve its sales and profit?<br>

**Methodologies**

- Analyzed the total monthly sales for the store using the pandas groupby object
- Also analysed the store sales by category in a proportion form using a pie chart
- To view which product groups contribute significantly to the store sales, I used a bar chart to illustrate this.
- Repeated all the above now analysing the store's profit, see results below.

**Results**

#### Sales Analysis

##### Sales contribution analysis by product field category

- From the pie chart we can clearly observe that the store generates most of it's sales from Technology equipment followed by furniture and lastly Office Supplies

##### From the chart we can observe the following

- Chairs and Phones generate the highest sales for the store

- While Envelops, Fasteners, labels and Art do not contribute significantly to store sales

- This also makes sense since we have also observed that furniture and Technology contribute significantly to the store sales

#### Profit Analysis

- The store generated good profit in March, September and December in comparance to the other nearby months

- The store started to make a good growing profit starting from the month of July till the month of December

- A potential investor would prefer investing in the store company after june since the store started to make a gradually increasing profit whereas in the beginning of the year the profit was flunctuating which makes it difficult for predictions and hence this would reflect a lot of risk for the investor

From the bar chart, the store generates most of it's profit from selling Copiers, Accessories and Phones

It is also clear that the store is making losses from selling Bookcases, Suppliers and Tables. One would recommend that the store should stop selling these items.

From the plot, we can see that chairs, copiers, phones and Binders contribute significantly to sales and also to profit. The profit generated from these items also exceeds the average profit generated from selling all the store items.

On the other hand, tables also contribute significantly to sales but the store generates losses from selling them.

So this is an indication that not all products that contribute to sales significantly will also generate a lot of profit for the store
